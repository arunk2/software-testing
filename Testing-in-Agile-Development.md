Testing & Quality in Agile development:
==========================
Agile testing must be iterative, as the agile requirements activities, and design activities, and construction activities, are iterative in nature. Agile testers cannot rely on having complete specifications, as the requirements are identified, explored, and implemented throughout the lifecycle.  There isn't a single requirements phase which produces a comprehensive requirements specification, therefore test strategies cannot rely on having a complete specification available.

## Agile Testing Strategies:

* Development team testing (TDD or test-immediately after approach)
* Parallel independent testing
* end-of-lifecycle testing

## Agile Quality Strategies: 
* Refactoring, Non-solo development, Static and dynamic code analysis, Short feedback cycles, Standards and guidelines
* Reviews and inspections
  * Iteration/sprint demos
  * All-hands demos
  * Light-weight milestone reviews
