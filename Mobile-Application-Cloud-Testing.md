Testing for Mobile Applications
===============================

## Problem in Mobile Testing
To maximize business transactions over mobile services, it is essential to ensure optimal performance 
and user experience regardless of the type of his handset, operating system, geographical location and network service provider. 
To achieve this, innovative testing techniques are required to be implemented to ensure service quality 
and compatibility across various mobile devices.

However, due to the lack of standardization, 
availability of sample testing devices along with the variety of screen sizes and resolutions, 
operating systems and versions, 
it is nearly impossible for the developers and testers to maintain a decent performance level for the end application.

## Solution

A cloud-based testing approach for mobile applications which is capable of meeting the above challenges in mobile application testing. 
This innovative approach offers Web-based access to a large pool of real handsets and devices connected to live networks spread globally, 
providing developers/enterprises with end-to-end control for manual and automated testing practices.

Implementing a cloud-based testing approach with agile testing methodologies for mobile applications is the need of the hour to quickly 
and cost-effectively respond to rapidly changing markets, with a satisfactory level of service quality 
and compatibility maintained across the wide variety of available mobile devices.
